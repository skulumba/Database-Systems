    u.name AS university_name, 
    f.position, 
    COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM 
    faculty f 
INNER JOIN 
    university u ON f.university_id = u.id 
GROUP BY 
    u.name, 
    f.position;
```

This feature allows the user to delete a keyword from the database. The user can enter the ID of the keyword in the input field and click the "Delete" button to delete the keyword from the database.

```sql
-- Trigger to log deleted keywords
CREATE TRIGGER keyword_delete_trigger AFTER DELETE ON keyword FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN 
    INSERT INTO keyword_log (id, name, deleted_at) VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.name, NOW()); 
END;

-- Table to keep track of deleted keywords
CREATE TABLE keyword_log (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(512),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
